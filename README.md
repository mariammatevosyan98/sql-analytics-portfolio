### Building Dummy Database for Testing 
1. I created a new GitHub Repository. I named the Repository   **sql-analytics-portfolio**.
2. I created a new folder in my Desktop named **aca**. I opened it all in VS Code using the Terminal and seved the project using the Project Manager.

3. Inside the Project, I created new folder named **data**. In the **data**, I created new 4 files named **customers, employees, orders, products, sales** and placed the dummy data in it.
4. In **.gitignore** file, I added two lines named **pgadmin_data** and **postgres_data**.
5. Inside the Project, I created new folder named **init** and in **init** folder, I created 2 new file named **01_schema.sql** and **02_etl.sql**. I placed the intended codes in each file.
6. I created a new file named **.env** in the Project and added intended scripts to te file.
7. I created a new file named **docker-compose.yaml** in the Project  and added intended code to the file.
